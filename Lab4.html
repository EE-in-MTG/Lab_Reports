        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
This report explores the concept of fractal trees, a recursive geometric structure that mimics natural branching patterns and exhibits self-similarity at various scales. Using Turtle Graphics, a program is implemented to generate a fractal tree by recursively splitting branches into smaller sub-branches at a fixed angle and scale. Fractal trees serve as a fundamental example of recursion in geometry, where each branch continuously divides following a defined pattern. By applying recursive algorithms, this study demonstrates how fractal trees model naturally occurring structures such as trees, rivers, and lightning bolts. A base case is assigned to control recursion and prevent infinite branching. The goal of this report is to analyze the implementation of fractal trees, understand the role of recursion in their formation, and explore their significance in computational geometry, computer graphics, and natural simulations.

	      <h3>a. Recursively draw fractal trees</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
This lab begins by defining a function, fractal_tree with the lenth and depth parameters. When the tree is in th eoutput, the first impression is to count how many branches, this is always the same aount and is equal to the variable depth. 
        </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Function to draw a fractal tree using recursion
def fractal_tree(length, depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return
    else:
        forward(length)
        left(30)

        fractal_tree(length * 0.7, depth - 1)

        right(60)

        fractal_tree(length * 0.7, depth - 1)

        left(30)
        backward(length)
</code></pre>
	      
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
The next function defined in the code is sierpinski_triangle, which takes the length argument and an additional argument named order. This function is implemented using an if/else statement and utilizes recursion, progressively reducing the order variable until it reaches the base case. The code reduces the length by a factor of 2, and the function calls itself recursively, much like in Lab 2. Additionally, the sierpinski_triangle function includes two backward function calls in the code below.
</p>		
<pre><code class="language-python">
# Define the recursive Sierpinski triangle function
def sierpinski_triangle(length, order):
    if order == 0:
        draw_triangle(length)
    else:
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        forward(length / 2)
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        backward(length / 2)
        left(60)
        forward(length / 2)
        right(60)
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        left(60)
        backward(length / 2)
        right(60)
</code></pre>	
	      
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
The inclusion of backward allows multiple triangles to be nested within the outer triangles. The concept of order and recursion ensures that the smallest inner triangles are drawn at order zero. The table below compares the values of the variables order and length. Based on the table and the code, a triangle is only drawn when length reaches 25, which is the smallest calculated length.	
</p>

The image below illustrates how changing the order variable from 4 to 2 in the lower section affects the number of inner triangles created. When the order is reduced, fewer recursive calls are made, resulting in a simpler structure. However, the forward, backward, left, and right functions still manage the placement of three sections, maintaining the same order and length distribution.

This example of recursive function calls draws the smallest set of triangles first, using a variable decrement to reach the base case. To calculate the total number of the smallest triangles drawn, we can relate it to the variable order using the formula: $$ =3(n^n), $$ where n represents the recursion depth (order). This exponential relationship demonstrates how increasing the order significantly increases the number of triangles drawn.

<h4>b. Cellular Automata</h4>

	
      </section>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">	      
The next section of the lab imports the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries, assigning them shorthand names for convenience.
NumPy is imported and referenced as np.
Matplotlib's pyplot module is imported and referenced as plt.
This setup is a common practice in Python programming, allowing for efficient use of mathematical operations and visualization functions from these libraries.
</p>	
	    
<pre><code class="language-python">
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</code></pre>

	    
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
This code utilizes a numerical array, starting with the initialization of a 100 × 100 matrix filled with zeros. This matrix represents an m × n grid, where m denotes the number of rows and n denotes the number of columns.

To demonstrate how the plot will be used, a single value of 1 (representing an "on" state in binary) is placed at coordinate (0,50). This placement is then visualized using a plot, showing a white cell at the center of the top row while all other cells remain black.

This setup establishes the initial condition for a cellular automaton, where the first row begins with a single active cell, influencing the subsequent pattern evolution.
</p>		
	    
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
Next, the lab creates a variable named num and initializes it with the value 90. A print statement is then used to display the 8-bit binary representation of num.

Following this, a three-dimensional array of size 2 × 2 × 2 is created. After initialization, multiple array locations are assigned values in binary order. However, due to the nature of binary representation, the number 90 in binary can be interpreted in both normal and reversed order, making it unclear which bit is the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and which is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).

This ambiguity arises because reading the binary sequence from top to bottom or bottom to top yields the same output, making it necessary to explicitly define the bit-order convention for proper interpretation.
</p>
	    
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
The function CA(X) is defined and called using the 100 × 100 array created earlier. Initially, this array contains a single "on" (1) value at coordinate (0,50), with all other cells set to "off" (0).

This function iterates through the grid and applies the predefined "rule" (created earlier) using the binary representation of 9, which serves as a lookup table. The three-dimensional array (2 × 2 × 2) allows for comparison of three neighboring values—the previous row's left, center, and right values—to determine the new cell state in the next row.

Each time the rule is applied, it assigns a 1 (on) or 0 (off) value based on the corresponding rule entry. The loop processes downward through the output grid, updating each row by comparing the values from the previous row.

The following image and table illustrate how the first few rows evolve, showing how the pattern expands based on the rule.

The table illustrates the beginning of the Sierpiński Triangle, showing how the pattern starts to form. As the rule is applied iteratively, the triangular fractal structure continues to expand throughout the image output below.

Each subsequent row follows the recursive rule, creating a self-similar pattern that grows symmetrically based on the binary rule logic.

<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
The image displayed in the output cell represents the shape generated by the applied rule. This specific rule is known as Rule 90. The Sierpiński triangle emerges due to the behavior of the Exclusive OR (XOR) logic gate, meaning that a cell is activated (1) only when exactly one of its two neighboring cells from the row above is active.

Rule 90 belongs to the class of additive elementary cellular automata [1], where the next state of each cell is determined by a simple binary addition modulo 2 (XOR operation). This results in the characteristic fractal-like, self-similar pattern seen in the output.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">
The next section introduces an alternative approach to implementing the cellular automaton. Instead of using a 3D array as a lookup table, this version utilizes a formula to achieve the same outcome.

The formula used is: 
	$$ X[i, j] = (rule / (2**(4*X[i-1,j-1] + 2*X[i-1,j] + X[i-1,j+1]))) % 2 $$ 

This formula calculates the output based on the current values of i and j (or m and n, representing rows and columns) in the previous row.This approach is mathematically equivalent to using a lookup table, as the modulus operation ensures that only the relevant rule bit is used in determining the cell's state.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">    
	The previous setup of mathimatical generations is finally altered by changeing the value of the variable "rule". 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
for rule in [30, 62, 90, 110, 126]:
    plot(CA(C))
</code></pre>
<p style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 1.6;">    
The for loop iterates through different values of rule, applying the CA (cellular automaton) function and plotting the results.

Rule 30 is classified as chaotic and was of special interest to Stephen Wolfram. It has been studied for its random-like behavior and can even be used as a random number generator [2].
Rule 62 is another elementary cellular automaton that determines the next state based on previous neighbors. It is also the mirror image of Rule 118 [3]. The asymmetrical output appears with a diagonal structure on the left side of the screen, while the right side exhibits horizontal repeating patterns.
Rule 90 generates the Sierpiński Triangle, as described earlier.
Rule 110 follows the same process and has a binary representation of 110 = 01101110 (calculated as 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 110) [4]. An interesting observation is that the left half of the screen is populated, while the right half remains empty.
Rule 126 is classified as amphichiral [5]. This means it is superposable with its mirror image, meaning the pattern remains unchanged when reflected [6].

        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>
          This lab the implements and visualizes elementary cellular automata using Python. The focus of labs include recursive structures, bitwise operations, and rule-based pattern generation, particularly in the context of the Sierpiński Triangle and numerical bitwise based Wolfram rules.

The first section introduced recursion through the sierpinski_triangle function, which used recursion to create equilateral triangles patterns. The relationship between recursion depth  variable "order" and the number of smaller triangles drawn was analyzed to show how recursion increases exponentially.

The second part of the lab introduced cellular automata with a 100 × 100 array initalized with a single 1 at (0,50) and the remaining all zeros. Using Rule 90, the well-known Sierpiński Triangle was generated based on Exclusive OR, XOR logic, where a cell becomes active if only one of its two neighboring cells is active. After using a lookup tables,a mathematical operation was used to complete the same task for the Sierpiński Triangle, both ways created the same output cell.

The final section expanded upon elementary cellular automata, comparing several different Wolfram rules.

Rule 30, noted for its chaotic behavior, has potential applications in random number generation.
Rule 62, a mirror image of Rule 118, exhibited asymmetrical diagonal patterns with repeating structures.
Rule 90, forming the Sierpiński Triangle, displayed a predictable self-similar fractal.
Rule 110, Turing complete, showcased computational complexity where one half of the grid became populated while the other remained empty.
Rule 126, identified as amphichiral, demonstrated symmetry in its mirrored output.
Through this lab binary rules created complex patterns by mathematical logic and recursion in Python software functions.
