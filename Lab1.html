        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           This report is for assignment Lab 1 in Course MTG 6415 Fractal Geometry. Using the provided template,
	this lab is the introduction using GitHub for lab submission and Google's Colab for Python scripting in 
	a Jupiter Notebook like environment.  
	 Some important concepts for this assignment are to add details, include figures, provide code, use equations and extend the code.

    <h3>a. GitHub Navigation and How to Edit</h3>
    <p>
      Presenting data in GitHub uses HTML format. When creating a new document, the name of the document must have the file extension <code>.html</code>. Otherwise, an error like the one shown in Figure 1 below will occur.
    </p>

      />

    </figure>
	  
    <p>
      The other requirements for HTML include correct syntax, which can be learned from templates. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT can clarify syntax questions. For example, this section was added as a subheading.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finding a resource about saving a default soft-wrap setting, it was easier to understand that GitHub is not the editor, the primary goal should be viewed as version control. Additional insights revealed differences between GitHub and local editors. The complexitivity to make this change weas omitted to stay focused on the task on the lab 1.
    </p>
	  
    <p>
	For successfully editing GitHub templates for display, understanding branches, previews, and collaborative workflows is needed for a work flow to publish content. These features allow multiple users to collaborate and compare changes before publishing a final version such as in figure 2 below.  
    </p>
    <figure>

      />

	  <p>
	  For an alternative, the "Edit in Place" option was faster for edits without requiring a pull request. To relate other code to HTML and ask how to code and paste into online HTML editors to correct the syntax. How to comment in HTML, add spacing, or correct placement when inserting an image into code will be a challenge and should be able to use tools to get past issues. Additionally, the code is not being scanned with Grammarly, a writing enhancement software, for suggestions to correct grammar and spelling.

	The HTML code on GitHub requires selecting to edit, syntax, and committing to saving those changes. A consideration for the GitHub and HTML code is the time to live update when a commitment can be seen in the browser leads to making additional live updates and checking work later for making changes.

    <h3>b. Intro to Turtle Graphics</h3>
    <p>
	For setting up the Turtle environment, this course uses a Google account for Google Colab and is stored on Google Drive. In my Google Drive, I have a file named "Copy of Module 1 Hahn MTG 6415 Fractal Geometry 2024" which opens as an extension ".ipynb" which is the same as a Python notebook in Jupyter Notebook. Access is set to private which may be automatically defaulted and could cause issues if trying to later share a link to an assignment to a professor or trying to access from another Google account user browser such as a phone. Python package information is provided on screen when accessing the notebook as "Python package inclusions google-genai 0.3.0". When looked up online is reference to a package that can be used with AI called SDK. Recording the version here for reference later in case of incompatible or update issues later and will not research more now to stay within the scope of this lab. 
	    Already familiar with Jupyter Notebook and able to comprehend running cell and clearing output and the syntax of Python. This looks exactly like Jupyter Notebook. For drawing simple shapes and polygons the template provides is mainly two sections for drawing after the initialization is complete. This leads to altering the variables for testing parameters for the display cell of geometrical like drawings can be altered by Python code. like in Figure 4 below.

	  <p>
The observation from the generated code involes coding concepts like functions and loops. When calling functions and adjusting the arguments, or parameters, changes can be seen for position and color. Seems initial jumpo and face functions present the turles, the the for loop is mainly going to provide the "drawing" of shapes.The turn function takes the numerical argument in degrees. This may need to be remebered and data pre processed if formulas are used that are made for radians. The fiure below show the code wna dwhen the shape was drawn as open due to the change in angle the turtle did not end on a vertex, or as in enginering a node, or junction. This may be key to the recursive nature of the for loop being able to alter away from traditional shapes. A note should be made that when the for loop was place in a high number, the shape took on a circle and could be a cause for looking into the resolution of the out put cell and in a zoom function, or slider can be incorporated wher mathimatically and the visual presentation off data are not going to be distinquishable.    The next section usies the pen up and pen down to draw multiple shapes

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
	This lab focuses on GitHub for lab submissions and Google Colab for Python code access in a Jupyter Notebook-like environment. Practicing and familiarity with code, including editing and managing HTML reports on GitHub. Lab 1 also includes navigating branching, editing in place, and implementing Python code for geometric drawings using Turtle Graphics.

	In the Intro to Turtle Graphics, Google Colab ran Python scripts to draw geometric shapes. Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook simplified the setup and execution of Python code. Observing the relationship between variables and drawing shows Python calling built-in Turtle functions. The package version was documented for future troubleshooting without losing the focus of this assignment.

	This lab is an introduction to the technical tools for the course, which seems like they will be needed as a reference for later labs. The included templates help reduce time spent troubleshooting code on GitHub, Google Colab, and Python. While some of the GitHub interaction and document management are unfamiliar, being able to reference in later labs will be a need in future labs.
